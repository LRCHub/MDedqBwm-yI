```lrc
[00:13.00] Don't be that way
[00:17.00] Fall apart twice a day
[00:21.00] I just wish you could feel what you say
[00:27.00] Show, never tell
[00:31.00] But I know you too well
[00:35.00] Got a mood that you wish you could sell
[00:41.00] If teardrops could be bottled
[00:46.00] There'd be swimming pools filled by models
[00:52.00] Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
[01:00.00] If "I love you" was a promise
[01:05.00] Would you break it, if you're honest?
[01:11.00] Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
[01:20.00] I don't wanna be you, anymore
[01:31.00] Hand, hands getting cold
[01:36.00] Losing feeling is getting old
[01:41.00] Was I made from a broken mold?
[01:47.00] Hurt, I can't shake
[01:51.00] We've made every mistake
[01:56.00] Only you know the way that I break
[02:02.00] If teardrops could be bottled
[02:07.00] There'd be swimming pools filled by models
[02:13.00] Told "a tight dress is what makes you a whore"
[02:21.00] If "I love you" was a promise
[02:26.00] Would you break it, if you're honest?
[02:32.00] Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
[02:41.00] I-I don't wanna be you
[02:47.00] I don't wanna be you
[02:55.00] I don't wanna be you, anymore
